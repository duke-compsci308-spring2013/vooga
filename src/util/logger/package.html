This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
<h1>Description</h1>
This package is the logger package. It contains a NetworkLogger that 
serves as a wrapper for a Java.util.Logger instance. It also contains
IVoogaHandler that serves as a way to get various Handlers to the 
NetworkLogger.
</p>

<p>
<h2> Specifics </h2>
A class that handles a logger. <br>
This class does not propagate LogRecords to parent Loggers, so if the
user wants to set parents or even more complex instructions, he/she
should call getLogger() to do so.<br>
It sets a console handler as a default handler.<br>
By default, the logger starts at ALL level so any type of message is logged.<br> 
Note that the user does not need to use any other class in this package
except this one to manage the logger
</p>

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> HandlerConsole, HandlerSocket, HandlerStream, HandlerTxt, and HandlerXML
all extend IVoogaHandler.

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> Create a NetworkLogger instance method, and then
use log(), info(), finest(), finer(), fine(), warning(),or
severe() to log something or addXXXHandler() to add a new type of handler.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> Obviously more IVoogaHandlers could be added to allow different approaches
on writing messages.
