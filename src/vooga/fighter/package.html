This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
Entry points into code:  Subclassing Controller, which deals with almost all running code (Explained below).
Developer will also need to subclass GameManager, which is encompasses the entire code framework, and 
is above the scope of an individual controller. 


<p>
To use our framework to create a game, a Game Developer should first subclass GameManager, and at the very
least overwrite the method setFilePathway(), in order to give a new base filepath for all of resource/
xml files to be used.  Currently, the base file path is set as vooga.fighter. so the developer will have 
to choose accordingly. Also, when they change this file path, they have to make sure to copy over all of the xml,
resource files to the file directory (keeping those in config in a config file, and those in images in an images file).
They then have the freedom to change these xml/resource files as they so choose.  Changing these xml files is the 
first level we offer for game customization, as this is how a developer would add in new characters, environmental
objects, maps, any strings displayed, menus, and all images.

<p>
The next level of game customization comes from subclassing the controller.  Typically, one will choose to subclass 
either MenuController, to create a new menu screen, or LevelController, to create a new fighting level. Just make sure
to add that controller to the FightingManifesto file.
Subclassing controller, one can:
<p>
Subclass the collision manager, changing the collide methods to define different interactions. Then make sure to
overwrite the mode initialization method, in order to put in the new CollsionManager.  One can also subclass collision
detection, in order to add in new Collision detector algorithms.
<p>
Change the input methods, as well as input pathway, in order to define new types of input to change the gamestate.
One must be sure to use the metho: super.removeListener() in the Controller's constructor in order to remove the
super class' listeners, before adding the game developer's controller to the input as a listener.
<p>
Change the specific objects that are loaded into the Mode, in the initialize mode method.  Therefore one can subclass
whatever type of object they so desire, and load in these subclasses in the initialize mode method.  They can then
subclass the collision manager to define special collide methods for these objects.
<p>
Change the winning conditions/add new winning conditions.  This is done by writing in line anonymous ModeCondition classes,
which then should be added to the win conditions using the addWinConditions method.  (Method is add endCondition in MenuController)
Also, one can define their own
unique conditions, using the same framework, writing in the anonymous ModeCondition for *something* to be triggered
should this condition arise.  Something is vague, because the developer had full power to change the state of what they
have access to in the controller. Which is a lot as we're finding out!

<p>
Change the actions of the specific mode being used.  This is done by subclassing the mode class (or level/menu mode), 
and writing your own, including an update method that does what the developer desires.  One can also just subclass one
of these classes and add the appropriate getters and setters if they want to give their controller even more power.  Then
they must make sure to create this mode in the Load Mode method of the controller.

<p>
In order to change the types of scores/the scores that are displayed, one needs to subclass gameloopinfo, adding in their
desired statistics, and then overwrite the method setGameInfo in Controller to set their own info.  Then in the NotifyDelegate
method of the controller, they should add the stats they want.  Then to display these stats they will have to subclass HUD builder
and make it track the appropriate stats, following the framework given.  One must also annotate them as demostrated in GameLoopInfo.
Finally, if they should want to keep track of these scores, one will need to subclass GameInfo, and then add their new scores
to this subclass with the appropriate getters and setters, and then use the makeGameInfo method of GameManager in their 
subclass of GameManager to change the GameInfo used.

<p>
Finally, if they want to insert something into the update loop (inside the super controller), they need only to
overwrite the method developerUpdate, which currently does nothing.

<p>
Other customization, although this is higher level 
includes changing the Canvas used, JFrame used (and size), GameInfo used (which stores scores, so changing scores will have
to briefly happen here, mentioned above),ControlProgressionManager Used, and ControlManager used, one will use the documented 
protected methods in their subclass of the GameManager. The Canvas controls the entire view, but it could be useful to
add small methods in order to customize painting.  The controlProgressionManager just handles grabbing controllers from strings, but
could be subclassed to include modes like a Tourney. 



<p>
In order to extend the display elements, a game developer would need to extend the HUDElement class AND override the update method (See an existing element for assistance). The new class can then be used in HUDVariable as a HUDClassName.
HUDFactory should be passed the package name of the extended HUDElements and will find both HUDElements in the package and the default vooga package.
