This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the engine for real time strategy, RTS, style games.

<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->
This package contains objects that are can be interacted with such as buildings and units.
These entities have strategies for attacking, occupying and producing.  These allow the entities
to be dynamically changed so that an entity that cannot attack could be upgraded to be able to attack.
In order to implement this, a developer would just have to set the attack strategy of the entity to CanAttack
and the entity would have all the functionality it would need to attack.  In addition, these entities store
a map of command to action so that the user can input a command and the entity will carry out the corresponding
action (for example exiting a building).  These entities will know if they have been selected and will also know
how long they take to build (for example how long it takes to create a unit once you click on that unit in the barracks).
Finally, these entities also have an upgrade tree since all upgrades will happen to entities that can be interacted with.
