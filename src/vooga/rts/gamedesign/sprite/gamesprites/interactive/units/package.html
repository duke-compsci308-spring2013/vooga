This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the Units class and all its subclasses. The units classes encapsulates all the functionality that we expect a Unit class to have and that a designer may require from a unit. All extensions of Unit can be used to make custom Units that have particular values, strategies and actions. 
</p>

<p>
The class extends InteractiveEntity because it has a gather strategy, which determines what resources it can gather and how it gathers them. 
It also has custom actions that other classes cannot access.
