This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the engine for real time strategy, RTS, style games.

<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->
The sprite hierarchy is implemented in the gamesprites package.  The highest 
level of this hierarchy is GameSprite.  A GameSprite implements IGameLoop and 
stores both the world location and the screen location of the sprite.  Examples
of GameSprites are tile, terrain, and GameEntity.

<p>
GameEntity stores the health of a sprite, its velocity, its team, and its state
(for example waiting to attack).  Examples of GameEntities are interactives 
(like buildings and units which are in the interactive package) and projectiles.
Projectiles are GameEntities beacause they have a velocity and a team but they are
not selectable like interactive are.  Additionally, the health of a projectile is used
as the amount of time that the projectile should exist if it does not hit its target.
