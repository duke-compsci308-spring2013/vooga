This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the engine for real time strategy, RTS, style games.

<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->
This package controls the possible states of a GameEntity such as attacking states,
movement states, producing states, occupying states, gathering states, and detectable states.
The Entity state class contains all the states that are used in the sprite hierarchy (some of the states
are only used in the strategies and are not in entity state).  One example of the states is using them 
to implement a delay in an action.  For example, when a unit can gather it is set to be waiting.  When the timer
to delay a gather starts, the unit is set to gathering.  Once the unit gathers (after the delay) the unit is set back to waiting.
This causes the unit to only be able to gather one time for a specified period of time (its gather cool down).
