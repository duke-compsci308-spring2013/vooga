This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the engine for real time strategy, RTS, style games.

<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->
This package contains the gather strategy.  Any entity that could ever possibly gather should have an instance variable
that is an GatherStrategy.  GatherStrategy is an interface that is implemented by CanGather and CannotGather.  If the entity
can gather then its gather strategy instance variable is set to CanGather, Otherwise, it is set to CannotGather.  The CanGather class
contains a gather amount, and gather delay, and a gather state.  By using the strategy pattern, 
the entities that could possibly gather can be dynamically changed during the game.  For example, a soldier might not initially be 
able to gather.  However, the soldier could be upgraded so that it can gather.  All that would happen is
the gather strategy of the soldier would be set to CanGather and the soldier would then have all the functionality it needs to gather.
