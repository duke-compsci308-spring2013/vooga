/**
 * This interface is implemented by the classes CanGather and CannotGather that
 * are then used as instance variables in the classes that could potentially
 * gather resources. If the unit currently can gather, it will have an instance
 * of CanGather, otherwise it will have an instance of CannotGather. Using the
 * strategy pattern like this, interactives ability to gather can be dynamically
 * changed. For example, a unit may be implemented such that it cannot gather
 * resources until it hits a certain level. The unit will initially have an
 * instance of CannotGather but once the level is reached it will switch to have
 * an instance of CanGather.
