This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the engine for real time strategy, RTS, style games.

<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->
This package contains the attack strategy.  Any entity that could ever possibly attack should have an instance variable
that is an AttackStrategy.  AttackStrategy is an interface that is implemented by CanAttack and CannotAttack.  If the entity
can attack then its attack strategy instance variable is set to CanAttack, Otherwise, it is set to CannotAttack.  The CanAttack class
contains a list of weapons so that if a unit can attack then it will have at least one weapon.  By using the strategy pattern, 
the entities that could possibly attack can be dynamically changed during the game.  For example, a worker (a unit that gathers resources
and builds buildings) might not be able to attack.  However, the worker could be upgraded so that it can attack.  All that would happen is
the attack strategy of the worker would be set to CanAttack and the worker would then have all the functionality it needs to attack.
