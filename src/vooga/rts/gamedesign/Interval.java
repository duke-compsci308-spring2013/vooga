 * This class was deprecated on 4/20/2013.  Use DelayedTask as a replacement.
 * This class deals with cooldowns.  For example, after a weapon shoots, it 
 * needs to have a delay before it can shoot again.  This class will take
 * care of setting that delay and correctly decrementing the cooldown so that
 * the weapon can shoot at the correct time again.  Additionally, this class
 * will be used to handle the cooldown times for producing a unit or making
 * a building.
