<!-- Fill this in with your high-level design and API examples -->
A weapon does not fit into the sprite hierarchy because it does not have an image.  A weapon is used to fire a projectile
if it is in the range of an enemy.  A weapon has a cool down time so it has a delay between fires.  A weapon also stores its 
range, list of projectiles that it can shoot, its position and its attacking state (whether it cannot attack, waiting, or attacking).
