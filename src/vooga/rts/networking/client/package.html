This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains classes and methods that work to access the server
from the client side and provide implementation for games. These classes
also work to initialize the client-side methods for browsing servers,
hosting a new server, and launching a multiplayer game.

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> This package contains some interfaces to help organize the task
distribution among classes. IClient, IClientModel, and IMessageReceiver
ensure that the proper functionalities are implemented to maintain
the client-side server working
</p>

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> 
Client.java is responsible for the communication between the user and 
the server. It relies on Sockets to conduct the stream of data. ClientModel
manages the user interface and what gets displayed. <br>
The class MapsAccessor is a helper that finds a specific .properties file
and returns a map with values in that file that are later used to fill up
the GUIs
</p>

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> 
In case a programmer wants to handle its client-side server differently, he 
should simply implement the given interfaces accordingly
