TODO

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> The classes from the view are commanded by ClientModel, which chooses
the appropriate view to display to the user

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p>
This package contains several GUI components that help put up A user friendly 
interface. <br>
ImageHelper contains some static and overloaded methods that shortens the 
process of creating images. <br>
There is a view that corresponds to the server browser, in which the user 
chooses among different games to join. There is also a view that acts as a 
waiting lobby while the game does not start. Both of these views contain
a table object that extend AbstractTableModel to display information.
</p>


<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> 
ViewContainerPanel can be adapted to receive one interface and set the main
panel, right, and left buttons accordingly. Other GUIs can be created and set 
through this class while the class would only neeed an interface reference from it
