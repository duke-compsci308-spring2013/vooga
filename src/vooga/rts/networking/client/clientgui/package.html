This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> The classes from the view are commanded by ClientModel, which chooses
the appropriate view to display to the user

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p>
This package contains several GUI components that help put up A user friendly 
interface. <br>
There is a view that corresponds to the server browser, in which the user 
chooses among different games to join. There is also a view that acts as a 
waiting lobby while the game does not start. Both of these views contain
a table object that extend AbstractTableModel to display information.<br>
The model of the client makes use of a ClientViewAdapter to handle the 
interactions between the view and the model
</p>


<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> 
ViewContainerPanel can be adapted to receive one interface and set the main
panel, right, and left buttons accordingly. Other GUIs can be created and set 
through this class while the class would only need an interface reference from it<br>
Also, the view adapter superclass can be used to meddle the actions between view 
and model.
