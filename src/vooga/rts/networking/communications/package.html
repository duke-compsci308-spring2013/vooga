This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the LobbyInfo classes, the default Message classes, and 
the TimeStamp classes.

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> 
ExpandedLobbyInfo extends LobbyInfo, Message is a superclass used in subpackages,
 and SystemTimeStamp
and UserTimeStamp extend TimeStamp.

<p>
TimeStamp is the class used to work with recording times messages are sent and received.
They can be based on system time (SystemTimeStamp) or arbitrary user-defined time 
(UserTimeStamp).

<p>
Message is the base class used to send info back and forth between the server and client. 
It contains methods dealing with comparison based on time and ways to track when the message
was sent and received.
In this package, there is also GameMessage which
is an empty subclass used by game genres to subclass for their purposes. 

<p>
LobbyInfo is a lightweight class used for communicating between server and client 
about lobbies that only need a few parameters.
ExpandedLobbyInfo contains much more information and is used when a client is inside the
lobby to get all the information about that lobby.
Both of these classes are intended to be attached to messages in order to be sent.

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> 
Messages are the basic class that is sent back and forth by the client and server.
TimeStamps can be used with Timers on client and Server with the UserTimeStamp or 
just with system time.
LobbyInfo is sent from server to client for the server browser and from client to server
for creating a new server. ExpandedLobbyInfo is used when a client is inside a lobby for
updating state about that lobby.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p>
Obviously Message is a class ripe for extension - it can be easily extended for any
type of client-server communication needed. GameMessage is intended to be extended by 
all genres (in this case, only the RTS is using networking, so there will only be one RTS message).
The TimeStamp classes can be extended for further differing behavior based on other times.
The LobbyInfo could be extended if one needed more info about the lobby not contained in
these classes.
