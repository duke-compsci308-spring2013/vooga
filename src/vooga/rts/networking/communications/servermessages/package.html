This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package represents all classes that are sent from the server to the client.

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> 
All classes in this package implement ServerInfoMessage, and must create one method:
affectClient (IClientModel model).  Classes that deal with the LobbyInfo object
extend the AbstractLobbyInfo class while those that do not extend the superclass
Message.  When needed, message that utilize the LobbyInfo from the superclass,
AbstractLobbyInfoMessage, are cast the LobbyInfo to ExtendedLobbyInfo

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> 
Server sends this message through the network, the client receives it and passes its 
IClientModel in. The message then afects this model in some way.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> 
A class could extend this through extending IClientModel to add new functionality.
