This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package represents all classes that are sent from the server to the client.

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> 
All classes in this package extend ServerInfoMessage, and must create one method:
affectClient (IClientModel model).

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> 
Server sends this message through the network, the client receives it and passes its 
IClientModel in. The message then afects this model in some way.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> 
A class could extend this through extending IClientModel to add new functionality.
