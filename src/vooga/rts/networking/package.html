This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the networking for the RTS game, including the client, server,
and communication between them.

<h2>The simple version of how to make an RTS game multiplayer</h2>
<p>
Have game classes implement NetworkedGame and IMessageReceiver. Instantiate a ClientModel 
with all its constructors. Override GameMessage with the necessary information for the game.
ClientModel will call loadGame (ExpandedLobbyInfo info, PlayerInfo userPlayer) when the
game is ready to load - the game should load the game based on this info. When startGame (IClient client)
is called, the game must set itself as an IMessageReceiver for the client and start the game.
The game can now start passing GameMessage objects back and forth to the server.
