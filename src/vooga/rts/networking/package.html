This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the networking for the RTS game, including the client, server,
and communication between them.

<h2>The simple version of how to make an RTS game multiplayer</h2>
<p>
In the properties file needed by the arcade, include the lines "multiplayer=true".
Include in the games.rts.(game name).resources package a file called
maps.properties. This file should include a list of keys of map names to 
values of the maximum number of players that can play on that map. In the
games.rts.(game name).resources.maps package there should be map files
with the same file name as the map name.
