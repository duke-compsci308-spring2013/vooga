This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package contains the example chat program.

<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> 
UsernameDialogBox and ChatPanel are view classes, ChatMessage is a GameMessage subclass that
also holds ID and a String message, and ExampleChat is the model for the chat program. The
IChatModel provides an interface between the view and ExampleChat. ExampleChatMain instantiates
the ExampleChat.

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> 
The ExampleChat starts by getting a user name through the UsernameDialogBox. It then calls the 
ClientModel to communicate with the server. Once that is done, it starts sending and receiving
ChatMessages and displaying them on screen.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p>
This is an example of how to use Client classes to work with the networking. The basic guide is in
the networking folder .package file.
