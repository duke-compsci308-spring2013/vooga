This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

</p>

<p>
This package contains the Building class and all classes that extend it. This package is where the game designer can add custom Building classes that extend building. See Tower.java for a simple example of how this can be achieved.

<p>
Building class:
	This extends the InteractiveEntity class by adding some functionality. 
	Buildings implement a standard health and a standard buildtime. They also implement rally points. These are used as a location to where units and other producable things can flock to once they have been produced or released from the building.
