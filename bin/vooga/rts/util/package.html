<body bgcolor="white">
<p>
This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.</p>
<p>This package contains the different util classes that are being used in the RTS engine. Most of these are pretty closed in terms of code and perform the functions that are required for this game engine.</p>
<p>TODO: Remove some of these and stick them in the main util package</p>
<p>Animation: Kevin</p>
<p>@see Animation</p>
<p>This is the Camera which is used to draw the map in an isometric view. It knows where in the map the players is looking, can covert between world and screen coordinates, and knows whether a position is visible or not.</p>
<p>@see Camera</p>
<p>Delayed Task provides the ability to create and run a task at a later time in the game loop.</p>
<p>@see DelayedTask</p>
<p>Dimension3D represents a dimension in three dimensions (X, Y, Z). This is not really used at the moment</p>
<p>@see Dimension3D</p>
<p>FrameCounter is used to measure the current FPS / frame rate of the game. It prints the FPS on the screen.</p>
<p>@see FrameCounter</p>
<p>Information is used to represent information about something in the game. This would be something such as the cost of production, etc.</p>
<p>@see Information</p>
<p>Location</p>
<p>@see Location</p>
<p>Location3D represents a location in three dimensions (X, Y, Z). This is used in all of our world locations.</p>
<p>@see Location3D</p>
<p>Pixmap</p>
<p>PointTester provides an easy way to test the camera and the isometric painting with multiple objects.</p>
<p>@see PointTester</p>
<p>ReflectionHelper provides helper methods to use reflection in an easy way. This is a static class.</p>
<p>@see ReflectionHelper</p>
<p>Sound</p>
<p>@see Sound</p>
<p>SpriteEngine : Kevin</p>
