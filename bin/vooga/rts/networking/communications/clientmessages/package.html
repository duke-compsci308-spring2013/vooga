This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
This package represents messages from the client to the server.
 
<h4>Class hierarchy</h4>
<p> 
Each message in this package subclasses ClientInfoMessage. All
of them use the method AffectServer (ConnectionThread thread, IThreadContainer server)
which acts in some way on the thread and server.

<h4>Workflow</h4>
<p> 
The ClientInfoMessage is created by the client and sent to the server.
The IThreadContainer that receives the message then calls AffectServer()
on the message, passing in itself and the thread that passed in the message.

<h4>Opportunities for extension</h4>
<p> Current examples include
Joining the lobby, removing the connection and logging out, or
requesting a list of all the current lobbies.
Extending ClientInfoMessage is as easy as writing a new message that
uses AffectMessage.
