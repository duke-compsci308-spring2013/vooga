This package is part of the CompSci 308 VOOGA Game Engine Project.

<p>
Entry points into code:  Subclassing Controller, which deals with almost all running code
or subclassing GameManager, which is encompassed the entire code framework, above the scope of an individual controller. ÊMost changes are made via subclassing the first class, as we will describe below.
<p>
To use our framework to create a game, a Game Developer would only need to subclass a controller, add that controller to the FightingManifesto file. Inside the subclassed controller, the developer would define his/her winning conditions, special conditions, and inputs. Of course, if the developer wanted to add inputs, he would add the inputs in the input file mapping. 

<p>
In order to extend the display elements, a game developer would need to extend the HUDElement class AND override the update method (See an existing element for assistance). The new class can then be used in HUDVariable as a HUDClassName.
HUDFactory should be passed the package name of the extended HUDElements and will find both HUDElements in the package and the default vooga package.
