Entry points into code:  Subclassing Controller, which deals with almost all running code
or subclassing GameManager, which is encompassed the entire code framework, above the scope of an individual controller. ÊMost changes are made via subclassing the first class, as we will describe below.
<p>
To use our framework to create a game, a Game Developer would only need to subclass a controller, add that controller to the FightingManifesto file. Inside the subclassed controller, the developer would define his/her winning conditions, special conditions, and inputs. Of course, if the developer wanted to add inputs, he would add the inputs in the input file mapping.
